# SAER
SAER Mode for movie dataset feature extraction
We a hybrid approach for building an effective Feature extraction system based on Sparse auto encoder that can also work as a recommender system that combines all the feature extraction modelling from deep learning techniques. The method uses a graph-based Sparse Auto encoder model to extract hidden features from social features found in the data attributes such as user ratings on various movies . The authors extract new features using Autoencoder feature extraction and cluster users based on the new set of features. The proposed method is called SAER (Sparse Auto Encoder for Recommendation ) and was evaluated on the MovieLens dataset, which contains users movie rating information. The results showed that the SAER approach outperformed many existing feature extraction algorithms in terms of recommendation accuracy and performed well in the cold-start problem
